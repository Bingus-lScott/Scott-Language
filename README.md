# Scott-Language
YOU MAY USE ANY CODE in this project WITH CREDIT and you are FREE TO CHANGE IT. 
* Heavily borrowed from CodePulse's How to make a Programming Language Series

Written in python 3.9.3


To use this language:
~~1) Write the code in any text editor~~
~~2) Execute the basic.py file in CMD or Terminal~~
~~3) Enter in the file path AND File into the input field~~

Currently the only way to use the language is to type equations into the terminal. Simply Execute Basic.py and type your equation in and you will get an answer. Errors will also be printed to console.


~~After this you code should be compilled and written to the console. (There also may be a file named~~
~~SLOUTDATA.txt in the same directory as your code if I choose to impliment this)~~



Documentation:
(will be filled out when I make an actual language to Document)
